<h1 align="center">BST Binary Search (Recursive)</h1>

## Performance
- **Time Complexity**: O(logn) in a balanced BST, but can degrade to O(n) if the tree is unbalanced and resembles a linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This space is required for the call stack during recursion, resulting in O(logn) for a balanced BST and up to O(n) for an unbalanced BST.

## Advantages
1. Binary search is very fast for large trees due to its logarithmic time complexity (assuming a balanced BST).
2. The recursive approach to binary search in BSTs can be more intuitive for some people.

## Disadvantages
1. Each recursive call adds to the call stack, so for large, unbalanced trees, recursion can lead to significant space usage and even stack overflow in extreme cases.
2. A BST can degrade to a linked-list structure in the worst case, making time complexity O(n).

## Terminology
- **Call Stack** - Part of system memory that keeps track of function calls during execution. In recursive binary search, each recursive call adds a frame to the call stack, which stores the functionâ€™s local variables and state. If the recursion depth is too great (e.g., in an unbalanced tree), it can lead to stack overflow.
