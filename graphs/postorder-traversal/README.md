<h1 align="center">Postorder Traversal for General Graphs</h1>

## Performance
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Each vertex is visited once, and all edges are processed at most once when traversing the neighbours of each vertex.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), for storing the visited set. In the worst case, the recursion stack can grow to O(V) if the graph has a depth resembling a linked list. The explicit stack in the iterative approach also requires O(V) space in the worst case.

## Recursive Approach

### Logic Flow
1. Start from a given vertex.
2. Use a visited set to track processed nodes and avoid revisiting.
3. Recursively process all unvisited neighbors of the current vertex.
4. Append the current vertex to the result list after all its neighbors have been processed.

### Advantages
1. Simple and intuitive to implement.
2. Naturally aligns with postorder logic through the recursive function call stack.

### Disadvantages
1. May cause stack overflow for graphs with large depths due to recursion limits.
2. Less control over memory usage compared to the iterative approach.

## Iterative Approach

### Logic Flow
1. Use a stack to simulate recursion and a visited set to track processed nodes.
2. Push the starting node onto the stack and mark it as visited.
3. Pop nodes from the stack, appending them to the result list (in reverse postorder).
4. Push all unvisited neighbors of the current node onto the stack.
5. Reverse the result list at the end to obtain the correct postorder traversal sequence.

### Advantages
1. Avoids recursion, eliminating the risk of stack overflow.
2. Explicit control over the traversal process with the stack.

### Disadvantages
1. Requires explicit stack management, making the implementation more complex than the recursive approach.
2. Memory usage for the stack can grow significantly in dense graphs.
