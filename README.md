## Description
Highly optimized and performant search algorithms for binary search trees (BST), graphs, and arrays. Each algorithm is implemented in both **C++** and **Python3**. Each implementation is accompanied with clear explanations of the underlying logic and performance-optimizing techniques, along with their applications.
